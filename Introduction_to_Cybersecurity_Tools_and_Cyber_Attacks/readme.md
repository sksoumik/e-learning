## Week 1
### Cybersecurity Definition
According to NIST, it is the protection of information systems from unauthorized activities in order to provide **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability**. These three principles are known as the CIA Triad.

- Confidentiality which is similar or equivalent to privacy. For confidentiality access to resources or data must be restricted to only authorized subjects or entities. **Data encryption** is a common method of ensuring confidentiality.
- Integrity on the other hand involves maintaining the consistency and accuracy of data over its entire life cycle. **Data must not be changed in transit**, for example, when it is sent over the Internet or using a local area network. It is very common to use **hash values** for data integrity verification. 
-  Ensuring availability requires maintenance and upgrading of hardware and software and operating system environments. So basically it is about keeping the **business operations up and running**, firewalls, proxies, computers everything has to be up and running 24 by 7, 365 days.

### Key Terms
- **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability is a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy.
For example, a software or an application that has code vulnerable to a buffer or flow exploit.
- **Threat:** Threat is an event, natural or man-made, able to cause negative impact to an organization. It could be a storm or a hurricane or a hacker, for instance. 
- **Exploit:** An exploit is a defined way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability. Like the buffer overflow example that I gave you before. An exploit could be a piece of code available on the internet to execute such attack against an application that happens to be vulnerable.
- **Risk:** Risk is the probability of an event or that an event could actually happen. In this case, the likelihood of a vulnerability to be exploited.
